## About CME's E-mini S&P 500

An electronically traded futures contract one fifth the size of standard S&P futures, CME-listed [E-mini S&P 500 futures and options](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/equities/sp/e-mini-sandp500.html) are based on the underlying Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 stock index. Made up of 500 individual stocks representing the market capitalizations of large companies, the S&P 500 Index is a leading indicator of large-cap U.S. equities.

While the futures contracts have relatively straightforward [specs](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/equities/sp/e-mini-sandp500.contractSpecs.html), CME has much more complex offerings of options that are settled into those futures. This allows traders and investors to have OTC-like flexibilities while also taking advantage of the liquidity of a central, electronic exchange market. In this post, we summarize the various option offerings and distinguish them by a few key features.
