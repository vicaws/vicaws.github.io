  abstract={Option price data are used as inputs for model calibration,
  risk-neutral density estimation and many other financial applications. The
  presence of arbitrage in option price data can lead to poor performance or
  even failure of these tasks, making pre-processing of the data to eliminate
  arbitrage necessary. Most attention in the relevant literature has been
  devoted to arbitrage-free smoothing and filtering (i.e., removing) of data.
  In contrast to smoothing, which typically changes nearly all data, or
  filtering, which truncates data, we propose to repair data by only necessary
  and minimal changes. We formulate the data repair as a linear programming
  (LP) problem, where the no-arbitrage relations are constraints, and the
  objective is to minimize pricesâ€™ changes within their bid and ask price
  bounds. Through empirical studies, we show that the proposed arbitrage repair
  method gives sparse perturbations on data, and is fast when applied to
  real-world large-scale problems due to the LP formulation. In addition, we
  show that removing arbitrage from prices data by our repair method can
  improve model calibration with enhanced robustness and reduced calibration
  error.},

  abstract={In this paper, we examine the capacity of an arbitrage-free
  neural-SDE market model to produce realistic scenarios for the joint dynamics
  of multiple European options on a single underlying. We subsequently
  demonstrate its use as a risk simulation engine for option portfolios.
  Through backtesting analysis, we show that our models are more
  computationally efficient and accurate for evaluating the Value-at-Risk (VaR)
  of option portfolios, with better coverage performance and less
  procyclicality than standard filtered historical simulation approaches.}

  abstract={Modelling joint dynamics of liquid vanilla options is crucial for
  arbitrage-free pricing of illiquid derivatives and managing risks of option
  trade books. This paper develops a nonparametric model for the European
  options book respecting underlying financial constraints and while being
  practically implementable. We derive a state space for prices which are free
  from static (or model-independent) arbitrage and study the inference problem
  where a model is learnt from discrete time series data of stock and option
  prices. We use neural networks as function approximators for the drift and
  diffusion of the modelled SDE system, and impose constraints on the neural
  nets such that no-arbitrage conditions are preserved. In particular, we give
  methods to calibrate \textit{neural SDE} models which are guaranteed to
  satisfy a set of linear inequalities. We validate our approach with numerical
  experiments using data generated from a Heston stochastic local volatility
  model.}

  lower hedging errors than Black--Scholes delta and delta-vega hedging

  performance to hedging using Heston models, while the former tends to be more
  robust during stressed market periods.},
