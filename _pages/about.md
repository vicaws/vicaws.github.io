Welcome to my personal site!

I hold a D.Phil degree in Applied Mathematics at the Mathematical Institute,
University of Oxford, supervised by professors [Samuel N. Cohen](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/cohens/index.html) and [Christoph Reisinger](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/reisinge/).
My research focuses on option arbitrage and market models of option dynamics,
with a substantial emphasis on production-level applications in data cleansing,
risk estimation, hedging and trading of statistical arbitrage. Readers who are interested in my research can download my D.Phil thesis from [ORA](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2b623ff5-0b7b-4950-828b-1b35b91e4537).

Since 2015, I have served various professional roles in quantitative research at
- [CME](https://www.cmegroup.com/) - an exchange and clearing house for futures and options;
- [Stable](https://www.stableprice.com/) - a FinTech start-up specialising in commodity exotic options market-making.

I am continuously doing academic research with ideas inspired by challenges in my daily work. I am also open for academic collaborations in reasonable formats; please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:wangsheng.victor@gmail.com) if you have great ideas and think that I might help with making them into reality!
